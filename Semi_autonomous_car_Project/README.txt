This project was a team effort focused on creating a semi-autonomous car with a control interface that could be used directly from a smartphone.

The car measured approximately 30 cm in length and was built using wood. All the code is written in Python, and we explored multithreading as an introduction to parallel processing.

The car featured three operating modes:

    Controlled Mode – Manually controlled via a smartphone interface.

    Autonomous Mode – Navigated independently in a controlled environment, moving around beacons marked with QR codes.

    Traffic Mode – Interacted with other cars, following a designated path and communicating with them to simulate traffic behavior.th other cars and would communicate with them.
